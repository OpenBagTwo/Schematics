# OpenBagTwo's Minecraft Schematics

This repository contains various [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica)
schematics I have created or modified.

Feel free to download them, place them in your single-player worlds and dissect them to see how they
work.

You're also **_encouraged_** to modify these designs, share them with others, build them on
multiplayer servers and make videos featuring these designs **so long as** you follow the terms
of the [license](LICENSE), which, in short, requires the following:

- Crediting the original designer (which—see below—is not always me)
- Making the schematic of your build freely available (to anyone watching your videos or anyone
  playing on your server), _including_ any modifications you yourself have made
- Publishing your modified design under the same license.

If following these terms presents an undue hardship for whatever reason, feel free to contact me
by [opening an issue](../issues/new/choose), and I'll either point you towards more permissively
licensed alternatives or potentially issue a dual license.

### AChromoss Moss, Pale Moss and Bonemeal Farm

A modified version of the Chromoss farm designed by
[**@maidofmoss**](https://www.youtube.com/@maidofmoss) (an official build tutorial can be found
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNYZiuVNBe0)) that's been reworked to collect pale
and regular moss in addition to outputting bonemeal.

### Mothership Resin Farm

Based on [a tutorial by Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usfxg7UCzks), this is my
personal resin farm, which collects 12-18 stacks of resin clumps per night from six creaking
hearts.

This farm is heavily constrained by my own personal use case, and I would not recommend using
it for anything more than inspiration.
